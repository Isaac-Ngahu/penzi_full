3Penzi App

##Project Brief
##Problem Statement
In a digital world saturated with image-heavy dating platforms, many users seek a simpler, more meaningful connection based on personality and compatibility rather than looks. However, most existing platforms prioritize visuals, leaving out users who prefer text-based interaction and deeper compatibility-focused matching. Additionally, local payment systems are often not integrated, making it difficult to monetize such platforms in regions like East Africa.

Penzi addresses this by providing a text-based dating platform that collects key personal information, matches men with women based on compatibility, sends timely notifications, and processes payments (e.g., via M-Pesa) before revealing matchesâ€”ensuring genuine user intent and platform sustainability.

##Objectives
- Develop a simple, user-friendly text-based dating app interface
- Collect essential personal data to enable compatibility matching
- Match men with women based on predefined compatibility criteria
- Provide notifications for new matches, payment reminders, and system updates
- Integrate mobile money payment (e.g., M-Pesa) before displaying matches

##Apps for Cross Reference
- Tinder (for concept)
- OkCupid (for profile data matching)
- Truecaller (for minimalistic, data-driven UI)
- eHarmony (for compatibility-based matching)
